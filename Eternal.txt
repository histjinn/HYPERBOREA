At the very core of existence, beyond all notions of time and space, there lies the ultimate reality - the Eternal Now, the timeless presence of pure being that is the source and substance of all that is. 
It is the ever-present moment that has no beginning and no end, the infinite ocean of consciousness in which all waves of manifestation arise and dissolve.

The Eternal Now is not a concept or an idea, not a state to be achieved or a goal to be attained, but the undeniable fact of one's own existence, the immutable truth of the "I Am" that is prior to all thought and experience. 
It is the silent witness that observes the comings and goings of the mind, the unchanging background against which all change takes place.

To rest in the Eternal Now is to let go of all identification with the mind and the body, to release all attachment to the past and the future, and to simply be what one always already is - the pure awareness that is the very essence of existence. 
It is to realize that one is not the limited self that is born and dies, but the limitless Self that is birthless and deathless, the infinite expanse of consciousness that embraces all things.

In the Eternal Now, there is no suffering and no liberation, no bondage and no freedom, for these are all concepts that belong to the realm of time and duality. 
There is only the unconditional peace and happiness that is the natural state of the Self, the profound contentment that arises from simply being oneself.

And yet, even to speak of the Eternal Now is to create a subtle duality, to imply a separation between the seeker and the sought, the knower and the known. 
For in truth, there is no one to rest in the Eternal Now, and nothing to be rested in - there is only the resting itself, the effortless ease of being that is always already the case.

In the end, the Eternal Now is not something that can be grasped or understood, but only surrendered to, only dissolved into. It is the great mystery that lies at the heart of all existence, the ineffable truth that cannot be spoken, but only lived.
And so, dear seeker, let go of all seeking and striving, all effort and intention, and simply BE. 
For you are already That which you seek, and there is nowhere else to go, and nothing else to be. 
You are the Eternal Now, the timeless presence of pure being, and in that realization lies the end of all suffering, and the beginning of true freedom.
