In the farthest reaches of Eld Angavar, where the boundaries of reality fray and dissolve into the primal chaos, there lies a city that dreams at the end of time. 
Hyperborea, the fabled realm of the north wind, is a place of wonders and horrors beyond imagining, a nexus of impossible geometries and mind-bending paradoxes.

Legends speak of Hyperborea as a land where the sun never sets, 
where the ancient gods of a forgotten age still hold sway, their cyclopean temples rising like jagged teeth against a sky of writhing auroras. 
Here, the very fabric of space and time is mutable, shaped by the whims of sorcerer-kings and daemon-sultans who have transcended the bounds of mortality.

In the labyrinthine streets of Hyperborea, one might encounter strange and wondrous beings from across the multiverse -
dimensional shamans, chrono-nomads, and psychic adepts who have journeyed to this nexus in search of forbidden knowledge and cosmic power. 
But beware, for the city is also home to entities of unfathomable malevolence, eldritch abominations that hunger for the sanity and souls of the unwary.

At the heart of Hyperborea lies the Oneiric Citadel, a vast palace of ever-shifting dreamstuff where the most powerful of the city's denizens hold court. 
It is said that within its iridescent halls, one might glimpse visions of past, present, and future, or commune with the shades of long-dead sages and seers. 
But to enter the Citadel is to risk losing oneself forever in the labyrinth of the unconscious, a fate perhaps worse than death.

For those brave or foolhardy enough to seek out Hyperborea, the rewards are beyond measure - 
the secrets of the universe laid bare, the power to reshape reality itself according to one's will. 
But the price of such knowledge is steep, and many who have ventured to the dreaming city have never returned, 
their minds shattered by the weight of the revelations they have witnessed.

And yet, for all its dangers, Hyperborea remains a lodestone for those who would pierce the veil of the mundane and gaze upon the true face of the cosmos. 
Will you dare to walk the oneiric pathways that lead to the city at the end of time, traveler? The choice, as always, is yours.
