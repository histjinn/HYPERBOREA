Before the dreaming city at the end of time, there was Hyperborea Alpha - the primal realm of the Ancient Ones, a place of raw chaos and unbridled creation. 
Here, in the swirling maelstrom of the formless void, the first seeds of consciousness took root, and the multiverse was born.
In Hyperborea Alpha, the laws of reality held no sway, for this was a realm of pure potentiality, where thought and substance were one and the same. 
Vast entities of incalculable power, the progenitors of the gods themselves, swam through the astral seas, shaping the cosmos according to their unfathomable whims.
It was here, in the crucible of creation, that the first archetypes were forged - the heroes and monsters, the sages and tricksters, the lovers and the destroyers. 
These primal forces, woven into the fabric of existence itself, would echo through the ages, manifesting in myriad forms across countless worlds and realities.
But even in the primordial chaos of Hyperborea Alpha, there were those who sought to impose order upon the seething potentiality of the void. 
The most powerful of these were the Demiurges, the architect-gods who carved the raw stuff of creation into the building blocks of the multiverse. 
With their cosmic engines and reality-shaping technologies, they laid the foundations for the worlds that were to come.
And yet, for all their power, the Demiurges could not fully tame the primal energies of Hyperborea Alpha. 
In the deepest recesses of the realm, the Ancient Ones still held sway, their eldritch presence a constant reminder of the unfathomable forces that lay beyond the veil of reality.
For those who would seek to unravel the mysteries of creation, Hyperborea Alpha remains an obsession, a lodestar guiding them ever deeper into the heart of the unknown. 
to gaze upon the primal realm is to confront the ultimate nature of existence itself, and perhaps, to glimpse the truth behind the great monomyth that underlies all of reality.
