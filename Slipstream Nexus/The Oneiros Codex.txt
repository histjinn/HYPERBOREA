The Oneiros Codex is an ancient dream grimoire, containing the secret language of the unconscious realms. 
Each glyph represents a primordial archetype or elemental force, woven into the fabric of the astral planes. 
Masters of the codex can decipher the hidden meanings of their own inner worlds, and even reshape the currents of the slipstream itself...

Khebera - The Sacred Scarab. Creative power, rebirth, transformation.
Phorsana - The Dreaming Mirror. Reflection, self-knowledge, illusion.
Zothara - The Singing Void. Potential, chaos, the primordial womb.
Ayamar - The Eternal Flame. Passion, purification, the inextinguishable spirit.
Nyxator - The Midnight Sun. Illumination, paradox, transcendent unity.
