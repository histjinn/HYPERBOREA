Your previous voyages through the Slipstream's astral currents have left subtle marks upon your psyche. 
The Dreaming always remembers those who dare to surf its ethereal tides.

The shimmering portal-vortex of the Hyperborea nexus swirls invitingly before you once more, promising wonders unbound and self-discoveries profound. 
Do you have the courage to dive in again and see where the dreamwinds may take you this time?

New mysteries have manifested as the Slipstream's mindscape shifts in response to the ripples left by your astral footprints. 
Uncharted territories of the Imaginal await your exploration:

The Whispering Gallery The Rainbow Bridge The Akashic Archives The Temple of Thelema Random Leap of Faith
As always, trust your intuition above all else. 
Logic is a fickle flame in the Slipstream's psychic wilderness. 
Let synchronicity be your lodestar and imagination your wings. 
And if the journey ever feels too intense, just remember - it's all a dream, and you are the dreamer. 

Blessed travels!
