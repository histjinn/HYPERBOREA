You stand upon the boundary between realms, the liminal space where dreams and reality intertwine. 
The veil grows thin here, allowing glimpses of the vast, uncharted territories that lie beyond the borders of waking perception.

The Dreamer looks to you expectantly, their gaze an unspoken question: 
Are you ready to venture into the mystical depths of your own psyche, to confront the shadows and uncover the light? 
The portal shimmers before you, a gateway to the infinite realms of the unconscious. The choice is yours.
