As you step through the shimmering portal, reality warps and twists around you, plunging you into a kaleidoscopic realm where the boundaries between dreaming and waking dissolve completely. 
Fragments of vivid imagery swirl past in a dizzying dance - familiar faces melting into grotesque caricatures, impossible landscapes defying geometry and reason, ethereal sensations brushing against your subconscious.

You find yourself at the center of an ever-shifting maelstrom of dreams, a phantasmagoria of the collective unconscious made manifest. 
Each illusory shard seems to call out to you, promising hidden revelations and unspoken desires awaiting just below the surface. 
But beware, intrepid dreamer, for in this chimerical domain, deceit and truth are intertwined - a misstep could lead you into the depths of delusion and madness from which there may be no return...

A fragment of your forgotten childhood, seen through a distorted lens...
The manifestation of a deep-seated fear, twisted into something strangely alluring...
An echo of a past life, rippling across the aeons to find you once more...
The shadow of a future self, offering a glimpse of what may yet come to pass...
