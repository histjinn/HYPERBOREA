You find yourself in a grand, ethereal hallway stretching endlessly in both directions. 
Wisps of dreamstuff swirl lazily through the air, brushing against your skin with a tingling, electric sensation. 
Before you stand three ornate doors, each emanating a unique aura and seeming to beckon you closer.
These are the antechambers of Hypnos, the primordial god of sleep. Each door leads to a different realm within his oneiric domain, promising dreams both rapturous and revealing. 
Yet the discerning dreamer knows that not all visions are to be trusted, for in the depths of the psyche, truth and illusion are two sides of the same shifting coin. 
Choose your path wisely...
